    <h1>Armenian-Style Potato Salad</h1>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Potato salad is the first food I remember eating, so I really do have a deep emotional attachment, but every so often, I crave something completely different—and this Armenian-style potato salad is completely different. And completely delicious. Serve drizzled with more olive oil and garnished with more fresh mint.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, quartered, and sliced into 1/4-inch pieces </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, or more to taste </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried mint, divided </li>
        <li>½ cup mild olive oil, divided </li>
        <li>1 large red onion, diced </li>
        <li>½ cup diced red bell pepper </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>⅓ cup lemon juice, or more to taste </li>
        <li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions </li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh mint </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Aleppo chili flakes </li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer sliced potatoes into a large pot with enough cold water to cover the potatoes by a couple of inches. Stir in 1 rounded tablespoon kosher salt and 2 ½ teaspoons dried mint. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and let cook until tender, about 15 minutes, checking every 5 to 6 minutes for doneness. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooked potatoes to a large mixing bowl and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>While potatoes cool, heat ¼ cup olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add red onion, red bell pepper, garlic, and a pinch of salt; cook and stir for just 1 minute. Turn off the heat and stir in remaining dried mint.</li>
        <li>Drizzle freshly squeezed lemon juice into potatoes and toss gently with a spatula. Add green onions, red onion mixture, remaining olive oil, fresh mint, fresh parsley, salt to taste, black pepper, chili flakes, and cayenne. Mix with a spatula until combined.</li>
        <li> Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled and flavors have melded, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Unwrap; stir, taste, and adjust seasonings as needed to personal tastes. The salad almost always needs more salt stirred in once it's tasted after being chilled. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
